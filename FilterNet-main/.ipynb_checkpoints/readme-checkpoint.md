# FilterNet (NeurIPS 2024)

The repo is the official implementation for the paper: "[**FilterNet: Harnessing Frequency Filters for Time Series Forecasting**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01623)".


## Getting Started

### 1、Environment Requirements

To get started, ensure you have Conda installed on your system and follow these steps to set up the environment:

```
conda create -n FilterNet python=3.8
conda activate FilterNet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2、Download Data
All the datasets needed for FilterNet can be obtained from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy) provided in Autoformer. 

### 3、Training Example

For datasets with a small number of variables, such as ETTh, ETTm, and Exchange, we recommend using **PaiFilter** as follows:
```
bash ./scripts/PaiFilter/ETTm1.sh
bash ./scripts/PaiFilter/ETTm2.sh
bash ./scripts/PaiFilter/ETTh2.sh
```

For datasets with a large number of variables such as ECL, Traffic, and weather, it is recommended to use **TexFilter** as follows:
```
bash ./scripts/PaiFilter/ECL.sh
bash ./scripts/PaiFilter/Traffic.sh
bash ./scripts/PaiFilter/Weather.sh
```
